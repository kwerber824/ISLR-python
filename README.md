# ISLR-python 2nd Edition
This repository contains Python code for a selection of tables, figures and LAB sections from the first edition of the book <A target="_blank" href='https://www.statlearning.com/'>'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'</A> by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2nd edition, 2021).<P>

This is a fork of the project created by Jordi Warmenhoven. The aim is to expand on his work by 'translating' the labs and exercises from the second edition of the book, since his project uses the first edition.

Note: This is an attempt to illustrate the concepts introduced in the labs/exercises using Python, not to show the best way to achieve the same outcome in Python. Therefore, code quality was sacrificed in an attempt to stay close to the source material. Regardless, any suggestions which achieve this goal with better code are welcome.
